📜 **Installation**  
- Requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods). These twos are the core components of modded Balatro.
- This mod provides its own Exponential Mult - an endgame feature derived from [Talisman](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman). While they are (mostly) balanced, it's recommended to also install [Talisman](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman) to maximize your experience.
